Current report delves into the new capabilities of mrpt-graphslam library and
provides a complete guide for using the \texttt{graphslam-engine} application.
More specifically it deals with the following:

\begin{itemize*}
    \item Description of major mrpt-graphslam library structure and concepts (e.g.\
        CGraphSlamEngine, decider, optimizers classes)
    \item \texttt{graphslam-engine} usage information (e.g.\ command line arguments)
\end{itemize*}

The extension of mrpt-graphslam library as well as the coding of the
corresponding graphslam-engine application was implemented as part of the
\textit{Google Summer of Code 2016 program}.
