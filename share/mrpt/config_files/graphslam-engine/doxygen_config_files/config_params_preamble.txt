The configuration parameters of the current class are listed below.
These parameters are parsed from an external .ini configuration file from their
respective section. If an optional parameter is not found a default value is
used instead. If a mandatory/required parameter is not found a runtime error is
raised. For a sample configuration file see
$mrpt/share/mrpt/config_files/graphslam-engine/laser_odometry.ini (Modify $mrpt
according to the path of your mrpt source directory).
